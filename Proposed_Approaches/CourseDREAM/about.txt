Here, you will find the implementation of CourseDREAM model for course recommendation and re-purposing it for the course enrollment prediction task provided in the paper. 
Explanation of each Python file:

config.py --> set the parameters
preprocess.py --> preprocess the training, validation, and test data.
offered_courses.py --> Calculate the offered course list for each semester from all the data. 
utils.py --> post-processing function to filter out if a course is not offered in the target semester or if a student took a course in prior semesters to recommend new courses.
data_helpers.py --> some necessary functions for logging information, loading data, and creating batches for training. 
rnn_model.py --> Define CourseDREAM model and feed forward function to calculate output from RNN where we use LSTM layers.
train.py --> functions to train and validate the model, compute loss and calculate recall score.
validate.py --> define functions to validate the model and calculate recall score for all courses and utilize the recommendations to estimate the number of enrollments for all courses and compute MAE, RMSE for all courses in target semesters in validation set.
validate_CIS.py --> define functions to validate the model and calculate recall score for CIS Departmental courses and utilize the recommendations to estimate the number of enrollments for CIS courses and compute MAE, RMSE for CIS courses in target semesters in validation set.
test.py --> define functions to test the model and calculate recall score for all courses and utilize the recommendations to estimate the number of enrollments for all courses and compute MAE, RMSE for all courses in target semesters of the test set.
test_CIS.py --> define functions to test the model and calculate recall score for CIS Departmental courses and utilize the recommendations to estimate the number of enrollments for CIS courses and compute MAE, RMSE for CIS courses in target semesters of the test set.
