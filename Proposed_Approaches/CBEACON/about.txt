Here, you will find the implementation of CourseBEACON model for course recommendation and re-purposing it for the course enrollment prediction task provided in the paper. 
Explanation of each Python file:

preprocess.py --> preprocess the training, validation, and test data.
offered_courses.py --> Calculate the offered course list for each semester from all the data. 
utils.py --> post-processing function to filter out if a course is not offered in the target semester or if a student took a course in prior semesters to recommend new courses, 
  functions to build knowledge and correlation matrix for training the model,
  and a fucntion to generate sequence of batches for training, validation and testing. 
cmatrix_generator.py --> create adjacency matrix (correlation matrix) calling functions from utils.py and save it.
layers.py --> create RNN encoder where we use LSTM Cell.
models.py --> Define CourseBEACON model and functions to compute loss. 
procedure.py --> functions to train, validate and test the model and calculate recall score for all courses and re-purpose the recommendation output to estimate the number of enrollments in courses and compute MAE, RMSE for all courses in target semesters. 
procedure_CIS.py --> define functions to train, validate and test the model and calculate recall score for CIS Departmental courses and re-purpose the recommendation output to estimate the number of enrollments in CIS courses and compute MAE, RMSE for CIS courses in target semesters.
main_gpu.py--> Set the parameters and call the functions from procedure.py file to compute MAE, RMSE for all courses in target semesters. 
main_gpu_CIS.py--> Set the parameters and call the functions from procedure_CIS.py file to compute MAE, RMSE for CIS Departmental courses in target semesters.
