Here, you will find the implementation of LSTM model for course recommendation. 
Explanation of each Python file:

preprocess.py --> preprocess the training, validation, and test data.
offered_courses.py --> Calculate the offered course list for each semester from all the data. 
utils.py --> post-processing function to filter out if a course is not offered in the target semester or if a student took a course in prior semesters to recommend new courses, 
  a function to build knowledge for training the model,
  and a function to generate sequence of batches for training, validation and testing. 
building_knowledge.py --> build knowledge for training the model calling functions from utils.py.
layers.py --> create RNN encoder where we use Multiple LSTM Cells.
models.py --> Define LSTM model and functions to compute loss. 
procedure.py --> functions to train, validate and test the model and calculate recall score.
main_gpu.py--> Set the parameters and call the functions from procedure.py file to compute results.
